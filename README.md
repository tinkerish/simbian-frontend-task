# Project Overview

This project is a frontend application built to demonstrate an interactive alert management system, showcasing two distinct workflows: "With Simbian" (AI-assisted) and "Without Simbian" (manual). The application is designed with a focus on user experience, leveraging animations and modular components to create a seamless and visually appealing interface. The codebase emphasizes reusability, scalability, and maintainability, making it easier to extend or modify in the future.

The user can toggle between the two workflows, view and manage alert cards, and track their status. The application allows users to interact with alerts in a smooth, dynamic interface powered by animations.

## Thought Process

The primary goal of this project was to create a clear and intuitive user journey for managing alerts while maintaining a modern and responsive design. The application is structured around reusable components (`Steps`, `AlertFlow`, `VerticalAlertCard`, etc.) to ensure modularity and reduce redundancy. React's state management were used to handle dynamic updates and transitions, ensuring the UI remains responsive to user interactions. Tailwind CSS was chosen for styling due to its utility-first approach, which allows for rapid prototyping and consistent design.

Animations were integrated to enhance the user experience, making transitions between states smooth and engaging. The logic for the alert flows was carefully designed to ensure clarity and simplicity, with each step of the process visually represented to guide the user. The project also aimed to balance functionality with aesthetics, ensuring the application is both practical and visually appealing.

## Animation Library Used

The project uses the `framer-motion` library to handle animations. This library was chosen for its flexibility and ease of use in creating complex animations with minimal code. It is used to animate transitions between steps, alert card movements, and other UI elements, providing a polished and dynamic experience. The declarative nature of `framer-motion` also ensures that animations are easy to maintain and extend.

The animations include transitions between alert states, smooth entry and exit for components, and animated gestures for alert interactions.

## Known Issues and Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**:

   - The current implementation of animations and state updates could be optimized for better performance, especially when handling a large number of alerts or complex workflows. Techniques like memoization (`React.memo`) and lazy loading could be employed to reduce unnecessary re-renders.

2. **Accessibility Enhancements**:

   - While the application is functional, accessibility features such as ARIA attributes, better focus management, and improved keyboard navigation could be added to make the application more inclusive for users with disabilities.

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**:

   - Although the application includes some responsive design elements, further testing on various screen sizes and devices could help identify and address layout issues. Tailwind's responsive utilities could be leveraged more effectively to ensure a consistent experience across devices.

4. **Error Handling**:

   - Currently, the application may lack robust error handling for edge cases, such as invalid alert data or API failures. Adding error boundaries and user-friendly error messages would improve reliability and user trust.

5. **Code Refactoring**:

   - Some components, such as `AlertFlow`, contain complex logic that could be refactored into smaller, more manageable functions or hooks. This would improve readability, maintainability, and testability.

6. **Testing**:

   - Unit tests and integration tests could be added to ensure the application behaves as expected under various scenarios. This would also help catch bugs early during development.

7. **Scalability**:
   - If the application were to handle more complex workflows or a larger dataset, additional architectural considerations (e.g., state management libraries like Redux or Zustand) might be necessary to maintain performance and scalability.

With more time, these improvements could significantly enhance the overall quality, performance, and user experience of the application.
